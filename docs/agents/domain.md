# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

This is a **single-context** repo: one `CONTEXT.md` and one `docs/adr/`, both at the repo root.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root: the glossary of domain terms.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-....md
│   └── 0002-....md
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because…_

## Related, pre-existing docs

This repo already tracks decisions in files that predate this setup. They are not ADRs, but they are load-bearing and worth reading before work in their area:

- **`LINEAGES.md`** — which experiment lineages are ACTIVE vs SUPERSEDED / FALSIFIED / PAPER. Read before starting work on any experiment.
- **`PARITY.md`** — when two numbers produced on different machines may be compared.
- **`.claude/CLAUDE.md`** — the project instructions loaded each session.
